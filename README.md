## Installation

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourfork/LearnByEmail.git
   cd LearnByEmail
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv learnbyemail-venv
   source learnbyemail-venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: learnbyemail-venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables (create a `.env` file with the following):
   ```
   # Required settings - SECURITY CRITICAL
   # Generate a secure key with: python -m app.core.security
   API_SECRET_KEY=your-secure-generated-key-minimum-32-characters-long
   
   # Your application's public URL (used for password reset emails, etc.)
   BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
   
   # Content generation (required)
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
   
   # Email sending (choose one method)
   # Option 1: SendGrid
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key
   SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=your-verified-sender@example.com
   SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=LearnByEmail
   
   # Option 2: Gmail SMTP
   GMAIL_USERNAME=your-gmail-username
   GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
   ```

### Replit Deployment

To deploy the application on Replit:

1. Create a new Replit from this repository
2. Add the following Secrets in the Replit environment:
   - `API_SECRET_KEY`: Secure random key (minimum 32 characters)
   - `BASE_URL`: Your public URL (e.g., https://learnbyemail.com or your Replit URL)
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key
   - `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: Your SendGrid API key
   - `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`: Your verified sender email
   - `SENDGRID_FROM_NAME`: Display name for sender (e.g., "LearnByEmail")

3. The application will automatically detect the Replit environment and use these secrets instead of a .env file.

4. Run the application using the Replit Run button or `python main.py`

## Running the Application

Run the application with:

```bash
python main.py
```

Or directly with Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:8000.

### Testing Email Sending

After registering and creating a subscription, you can test email sending immediately:

1. Go to your dashboard at http://localhost:8000/dashboard
2. Click the "Test Send Email Now" button next to your subscription
3. The application will attempt to generate content and send an email
4. Check the logs for detailed information (./app.log)

## API Documentation

FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation:

- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc
